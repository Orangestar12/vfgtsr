    <h1>Did you just hack my computer and/or cell phone?</h1>
    <p>No. This was a harmless prank. All your files are normal and, aside from a few new songs in your YouTube viewing history, no harm has been done to your device and no online accounts owned by you have been compromised. This is a static website - all code on this website runs on your device and never leaves it.</p>
    <p>Sorry if we freaked you out too much.</p>
    <h1>Why did you make this?</h1>
    <p>The domain was cheap, and my friend came up with this stupid vision in his head of a website that looked like this with this URL, and I was like "shit, for 12 bucks a year I'll do it."</p>
    <h1>Who are you?</h1>
    <p>I'm Daniel! I'm on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@orangestar1" rel="me">Mastodon.social</a> if you want to get ahold of me, or I'm on Matrix at <a href="https://app.element.io/#/user/@orangestar:matrix.org">@orangestar:matrix.org</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:orangestar@cats4gold.net">shoot me an email at orangestar@cats4gold.net</a>.</p>
    <p>If open methods of communication aren't your thing, I'm slightly less available <a href="https://twitter.com/orangestar1">on Twitter</a>, and my Discord is Orangestar#1432 - You can usually catch me <a href="https://discord.gg/undertale">running the r/Undertale Discord server</a>.</p>
    <h1>That juice is bangin', yo! Where can I see your tunes?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/188/484/8bc.jpg" class="strikethrough">It's paint, asshole.</a> I have a playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlBI1LA-Nk80rXLG5Fg89W-RnXnEZ4U_2">right here on YouTube</a>. If you're signed into YouTube already, then the last song you heard on this site will be the most recent song in your YouTube viewing history.</p>
    <h1>Yo man, you're using my music, and I don't appreciate that, dawg!</h1>
    <p>My apologies! Didn't mean any harm. Get ahold of me at one of the contact locations above and I'll remove your song from our list.</p>
    <h1>Who's hosting this stuff?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> is. If you're hosting a static site they're a very cheap option.</p>
